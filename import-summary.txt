ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* google-services.json
* images/
* images/android.png
* images/icon.svg
* images/image.png
* images/image.svg
* images/image_1024_500.png
* images/resized/
* images/resized/hdpi_icon.png
* images/resized/hdpi_icon.svg
* images/resized/ldpi_icon.png
* images/resized/ldpi_icon.svg
* images/resized/mdpi_icon.png
* images/resized/mdpi_icon.svg
* images/resized/xhdpi_icon.png
* images/resized/xhdpi_icon.svg
* images/scalesvg.php
* images/screenshot1.png
* images/screenshot2.png
* images/screenshot3.png
* releases/
* releases/Morze2Text4.apk

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
