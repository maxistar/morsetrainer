small application to learn Morse codes. You can run it on any android device. 
You can even install in to Amazon Stratos.
More information you can get on [the website](https://morse.maxistar.me/).

The project was made for fun and I support it from time to time. If you have a great idea what I can improve you can create a [ticket](https://github.com/maxistar/morsetrainer/issues).
