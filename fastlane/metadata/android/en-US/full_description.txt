This simple program is created to help you learn Morse code. You can learn Morse code keeping your phone in your pocket - the sound feedback helps you to know if you doing well or not.

There are some known issues to be fixed.
Known issues:
- sounds play simultaneously if you make several mistakes
- need to correct pronunciations for some sounds
- need better translation

This is beta version, please leave your feedbacks - this will encourage me create new versions sooner and make this software better.
